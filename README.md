Following steps where carried out in run_analysis.R script to come up with tidy data.

Step-1: Get the activities labels for test data

Step-2: Get the activities lables for training data

Step-3: Get subjects for test data

Step-4: Get subjects for training data

Step-5: Get the features list

Step-6: Get the test data and assign column names 

Step-7: Get the train data with activities, subject and features

Step-8: Bind test data with activities, subject and features

Step-9: Bind train data with activities, subject and features

Step-10: Merge test and train data


Step-11: Following variables were selected from the list of 561.
